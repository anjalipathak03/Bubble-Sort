# Bubble-Sort

# Sorting Algorithm

This is a Python implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Getting Started

To use this sorting algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This code is compatible with Python 3.

2. Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

3. Open the `sorting_algorithm.py` file in a Python IDE or text editor.

4. Modify the `numbers` list with your own set of numbers or elements that you want to sort.

5. Run the `sorting_algorithm.py` file to execute the code.

## Usage

The sorting algorithm provides the following method:

- `bubble_sort(arr)`: Sorts the input list `arr` using the bubble sort algorithm and returns the sorted list.

You can customize the example usage provided in the code to suit your needs. Feel free to modify, expand, or enhance the sorting algorithm.

## Complexity

The bubble sort algorithm has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. This makes it less efficient compared to other sorting algorithms, particularly for large lists.
